## About Me
I am a high school junior potentially pursuing a major in software engineering thanks in part to learning programming in APCSP this year and to my long-standing interest in technology. <br>
## About My Project
This project is a culmination of everything I've learned throughout the year. It serves as a window into what I've learned this year by featuring my projects from throughout the year and a profile about myself as a developer. This year I've learned the basics of both C++ and Javascript. In both languages I learned how to implement and call functions; how to create and use arrays; how loops and nested loops work; what conditionals and operators are; and about data types and variables. Outside of programming, I also learned about how the internet and computers operate. Additionally, I developed better reasoning and problem-solving skills as we racked our minds over each project, problem, and bug.  <br>
## My Site Includes:
    ● A home page 
    ● About me section 
    ● My projects from throughout the year 
    ● Links to my socials
## Projects:
    ● Stopwatch: It is a stopwatch that is able to record time and has the abilities to be stopped and reset.
    
    ● To-Do List: A to-do list which allows users to add tasks to their to-do list as well as ones from a list of suggested tasks. They are able to check off and delete each task on the list as well. 
    
    ● Connect 4: A recreation of the Connect 4 game where players compete against one another to get 4 tokens in a row. In this game, players can place their tokens on the board and if they achieve 4 in a row, they will win and the game will stop. Players are able to restart and play the game as many times as they'd like.
