## üé® Styling Help ‚Äì CSS Grid (Optional but Recommended)

Use CSS Grid to organize your layout cleanly.

**Docs:** [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
**Tutorial:** [CSS Grid Crash Course (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o)

### Example CSS Grid with Areas:

CSS
```
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
  "header header"
  "sidebar content"
  "footer footer";
}
.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.content { grid-area: content; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

---

### Scale Your Grid as Needed

CSS
```
.container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
  "header header header header header header"
  "sidebar sidebar content content content content"
  "footer footer footer footer footer footer";
}
```

---

### Why Use `grid-template-areas`?

* Easier to manage layout
* Named sections make HTML cleaner and easier to work with

## üìÑ What is a README.md?

A `README.md` file is a special file used to describe what your project is, how it works, and how to view or use it. GitHub automatically displays the contents of this file on your repo‚Äôs main page.

### ‚úÖ Use the Prompt Below to Generate Your `README.md` File Using ChatGPT

> üí° **Note from Mr. Alvarado:**  
> AI is a huge component in computer science, and learning to use it as a tool to accelerate your learning is essential. When used responsibly, AI can be a powerful assistant that helps you learn, grow, and become a better developer.

Please make sure to **update the example links in the prompt before pasting** it into ChatGPT ‚Äî this ensures that the AI includes your actual GitHub repo and live site.  
If you forget to update them, ChatGPT may include placeholders or incorrect links.

Copy and paste the prompt below, and once you have added your links to the repo and live site, you can submit the prompt to ChatGPT:

> Can you write a professional `README.md` file for my final portfolio project?  
>  
> Include the following:  
> - My first name and last initial  
> - A short introduction about me as a student developer (My main portfolio page already has this, so you can include a **revised version of what I wrote there** in the README.)  
> - A short paragraph about what this project is and what I learned this year  
> - An overview of what my portfolio site includes  
> - A section that lists the projects featured in my portfolio, with a brief description of each project‚Äôs features or purpose  
> - A link to my GitHub repository: `https://github.com/yourusername/final-project-portfolio`  
> - A link to my live site that is running through GitHub Pages: `https://yourusername.github.io/final-project-portfolio/`  
>  
> **Make sure to update the two links above to match your actual GitHub repository and your live site URL.**

### Formatting Reminder

ChatGPT can help you write it, but it can sometimes make formatting mistakes. Make sure everything renders correctly on GitHub.
