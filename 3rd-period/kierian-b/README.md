# Final Portfolio Project ‚Äì Kierian A.

## About Me
Hello name's Kierian Aren Bautista. I've always had at the very least a vague interest in computers and technology since I was younger, whether it be with Minecraft redstone or my love for computer parts in modern days. So when I saw that Mt.Eden Highschool offered AP Computer Science Principles I jumped at the opportunity to take it. As a programmer I know I have grown a long way since the beginning of the year, so in the future if I decide to continue following the path of a computer programmer I'll have some experience at least, and if I don't I'll have a pretty interesting hobby.

## About This Project
This final portfolio project is the culmination of my work and learning throughout the year. It showcases the skills I‚Äôve developed in web design, front-end development, and project planning. Through building this portfolio, I‚Äôve deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learned how to present my work professionally in a clean and engaging format.

## Portfolio Overview
My portfolio site includes:
- A professional homepage introducing who I am
