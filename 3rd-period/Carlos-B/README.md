# Final Portfolio Project - Carlos B.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Carlos B.**, a graduating senior with a passion for both science and technology. I’ll be attending **De Anza College** for two years before transferring to **UC Davis** or **UC Berkeley** to major in **Biology**. While my future plans are focused on the medical and research fields, this year I’ve enjoyed stepping into the world of web development, building creative and interactive projects that challenged me in new ways.

## 📚 What This Project Is

This portfolio project represents everything I’ve learned in computer science this year—from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and responsive design. It’s a personal website that shows off who I am, the skills I’ve built, and the projects I’ve worked on. Through this project, I’ve learned how to structure a website, write clean code, and design user-friendly layouts.
