## About Me
Hi, I'm Leonardo C., a passionate and curious student developer with a strong interest in web development, technology, and creating meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world applications and continually improving my skills through hands-on projects and learning from feedback.

## Project Overview
This portfolio project is the final culmination of everything I've learned throughout the year. From HTML and CSS fundamentals to JavaScript interactivity and responsive design, this project represents my growth as a developer. Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of user interface design, coding best practices, and the importance of clear project documentation.

## Portfolio Site Overview
My portfolio site is a personal website designed to showcase who I am and what I’ve built. It includes sections like an introduction, a list of my featured projects, my resume, and contact information. The site is responsive and accessible across different devices, with clean navigation and an intuitive layout.

## Featured Projects

### TicTacToe
A fully functional stopwatch app developed in JavaScript, providing precise time tracking with start, pause, and reset capabilities. The interface updates in real-time, displaying minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript timers (setInterval), state management, and dynamic UI updates. The design focuses on simplicity and responsiveness for use on any device.

### StopWatch
A fully functional stopwatch app developed in JavaScript, providing precise time tracking with start, pause, and reset capabilities. The interface updates in real-time, displaying minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript timers (setInterval), state management, and dynamic UI updates. The design focuses on simplicity and responsiveness for use on any device.

### QuizApp
A dynamic and responsive quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents randomized multiple-choice questions with a countdown timer for each question to challenge the user. The app tracks the user’s score, highlights correct and incorrect answers, and displays a summary at the end. Features include shuffled questions and answers, disabling options after selection, and seamless navigation between questions. This project highlights asynchronous timer management, event handling, and DOM updates.

### Cookie Clicker
An interactive incremental clicker game created with JavaScript. Users click on a cookie to earn points, which can be used to purchase upgrades that increase points per click. The app features animations, increasing difficulty and reward scaling, and simple state persistence. It demonstrates handling user interactions, animations with CSS and JavaScript, and implementing game mechanics like score tracking and upgrade logic.
