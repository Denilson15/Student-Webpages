# 🗂️ AP Computer Science Class Portfolio Projects

This repository contains the final portfolio projects created by students in our AP Computer Science class.

From initially learning C++ to transitioning into JavaScript and web development, each student has built a personal website that showcases what they’ve learned and the projects they’ve created throughout the year.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

Each folder in this repository:

* Belongs to an individual student
* Contains the complete codebase for their portfolio website and featured JavaScript projects
* Includes a personalized `README.md` file with a description and working links

## 🌐 How to Explore

To view a student’s work:

1. Open their folder (e.g., `alex-g/`)
2. Read their `README.md` file
3. Follow the link to their live portfolio site hosted on GitHub Pages

These projects reflect a year’s worth of growth in AP Computer Science, programming, and web development.
